Kate Flock | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nJoe Biden's cash-strapped presidential campaign has been talking to top donors about ways to beef up its fundraising strategy in the crucial fourth quarter, including a possible increase in spending on social media platforms such as Facebook, according to people familiar with the matter. They have also discussed a bigger emphasis on text messages that ask potential contributors to support Biden's campaign, said these people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The former vice president's campaign already sends texts to potential backers, and it is unclear what the message will be during the quarter. The development comes at a precarious time for Biden's campaign, as his fundraising and polling numbers weaken against an onslaught from progressive Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and fellow moderate Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana. The former vice president entered the race for the Democratic presidential nomination earlier this year as the clear front-runner. He enjoyed commanding leads in polls and got off to a fast money-making start with $21.5 million in the second quarter. However, he pulled in only $15.7 million in the third quarter, and had $8.9 million in cash on hand \u2014 both totals well behind Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg. He maintains a 6-point lead over Warren in Real Clear Politics' national polling average, but polls of early primary states such as Iowa and New Hampshire show Biden lagging or at risk of losing. The Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, both set for February, are the first contests of the 2020 election season.\n\nDigital grassroots struggles\n\nFundraising records illustrate Biden's biggest fundraising problem, namely appealing to the kinds of grassroots and small-dollar donors who fuel the Sanders and Warren campaigns. Beefing up digital efforts could help Biden's campaign in this regard. People familiar with the campaign's deliberations say boosting online efforts doesn't necessarily represent a major shift in strategy. Yet several of Biden's fundraisers believe that the campaign needs to improve its appeal to online donors. \"He can do more with online voters, but he's done surprisingly well,\" Biden supporter and former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell told CNBC in a recent interview. Other donors have been privately questioning where they can turn for sources of campaign funding as elections in the early primary states loom over the former vice president's organization. Earlier this month, Biden and his team rallied their donors at a summit in Philadelphia by calling on them to help them succeed on Super Tuesday primaries on March 3, when 40% of delegates are up for grabs. California, North Carolina and Texas all hold their primaries that day. A Biden spokesman did not return a request for comment. Biden's campaign has been behind in spending on Facebook ads that often entice contributors. Since he entered the race in April, Biden has spent $2.5 million on Facebook. Warren's campaign has spent $2.7 million and Sanders has bought $3.1 million in ads, Facebook's ad archive shows. Since January, President Donald Trump's campaign has spent $13.6 million on the platform.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., zeroed in on the company's policy chief Joel Kaplan, a former George W. Bush aide.\n\nWarren, a presidential candidate, mounted her latest strike in a series of tweets Tuesday announcing a plan to clamp down on the \"revolving door\" between the public and private sector. Warren said Facebook and other large corporations \"vacuum up anyone and everyone who leaves one of their government regulators in an obvious effort to leverage their new hire's political connections and use the allure of potential future job offers to extract favorable treatment.\" Warren's plan would bar \"giant corporations, banks, and market-dominant companies from hiring senior government officials for at least four years after they leave public office.\"\n\nAs Warren noted, Facebook is not the only company employing this tactic. Google recently hired former top Department of Homeland Security Official Miles Taylor, whom Buzzfeed News reported \"was involved in high-level discussions about immigration enforcement\" during the period of the agency's family separation policy, based on emails released through public records requests.\n\nIn her tweets, Warren said Facebook's lobbying spend has increased since its hiring of Kaplan.\n\n\"Since he was hired, Facebook spent over $71 million on lobbying \u2014 nearly 100 times what it had spent before Kaplan joined,\" Warren tweeted. As Facebook now faces at least three confirmed separate antitrust probes, Warren said \"Kaplan is flexing his DC rolodex to help Mark Zuckerbeg wage a closed-door charm offensive with Republican lawmakers.\"\n\nFacebook declined to comment on Warren's tweets.\n\nZuckerberg had private meetings with policymakers on both sides of the aisle during a trip to D.C. last month. Among the critics he met with was Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who has introduced a bill to remove tech's legal immunity from liability for their users' content unless they agree to submit to a third-party audit assessing the so-called political neutrality of their algorithms and content processes.\n\nKaplan was a strategic hire for Facebook, which has weathered attacks from conservatives who believe the company suppresses their voices due to a liberal slant among employees. People close to Kaplan told The Wall Street Journal that he is not a Trump supporter, but more of a traditional conservative. But his appearance at Justice Brett Kavanaugh's congressional hearing on sexual misconduct allegations last year stirred up Facebook employees who were angered by Kaplan's apparent show of support for the accused judge.\n\nAt Kaplan's urging, Facebook halted a project last year that was meant to encourage politically different users to engage in less-hostile ways, according to the Journal.

I mean, it\u2019s a kind of wild open season.\u201d\n\nAs chief of public diplomacy between 2013 and 2016, Stengel spent much of his time trying to combat propaganda by the so-called Islamic State and Russia, a subject he writes about at length in his new book, \u201cInformation Wars: How We Lost the Global Battle Against Disinformation and What We Can Do About It.\u201d\n\nWhatever gains have been made against the Islamic State, he said, could now be wiped out by an escalation in fighting among the various parties to the conflict. After talking to President Trump, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ordered attacks against Syrian Kurdish fighters to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d on his country\u2019s border with Syria. The Turks view the Syrian Kurds as having links to the PKK, a militant Kurdish group in Turkey that Erdogan views as terrorists. But they have been allied with the U.S. in the fight against ISIS and have borne the brunt of the combat, and casualties, for the past five years.\n\n\u201cSo the Turks and the Kurds will sort of go to war,\u201d Stengel said. \u201cThe Russians will come in on the side of the Turks. The Iranians will continue to back Assad. I mean, to me, this is like this just pushed [the war] down the road.\u201d\n\nThe most immediate danger, he said, is that thousands of Islamic State fighters who have been held in makeshift jails by the Kurds will now escape amid the fighting. \u201cAbsolutely, these guys can scurry back \u2026 and start committing terrorist acts in Europe. I mean, it's a really dangerous situation, which is why what Trump did is so reckless.\u201d\n\nPhoto illustration: Yahoo News; photo: AP More\n\nAnother big winner from the Turkish assault is Russian President Vladimir Putin, who, Stengel said, has wanted all along to see more Syrian refugees pouring into Europe.\n\n\u201cOne of the arguments that I make in the book that I don\u2019t hear picked up enough is that Putin\u2019s indiscriminate bombing in the Syrian war when they went in in 2015 and \u201916 was deliberate, to create more Syrian refugees to go through Turkey into Europe.\u201d\n\nThe Russians \u2014 and their propaganda outlets \u2014 played up bogus stories such as one about a Russian girl allegedly raped by a Syrian refugee in Germany. Even though the story turned out to be false, the Internet Research Agency \u2014 the troll farm in St. Petersburg that was active in manipulating American social media platforms in the 2016 election \u2014 played up the claims, and \u201cthe Russian foreign minister talked about it within 15 minutes,\u201d Stengel said.\n\nPutin \u201cweaponized immigration in Germany \u2026 and that bled over into the U.S.,\u201d he said.\n\nDownload or subscribe on iTunes: \u201cSkullduggery\u201d from Yahoo News\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "link": "https://news.yahoo.com/pullback-in-syria-could-prolong-war-two-or-three-decades-former-top-diplomat-says-192215706.html", "published": "2019-10-11T19:22:15+00:00"}, {"title": "To impeach or not to impeach? How Democrats should weigh the question.", "text": "\n\n\n\nIf Democrats were hoping for some shocking moment of revelation in Robert Mueller\u2019s testimony yesterday \u2014 if they thought that maybe he\u2019d plunk down a secret tape recording of President Trump and Vladimir Putin working out the Electoral College math for 2020, or that maybe Mueller would lift up his sleeves to display the tire marks from when Bill Barr tried to run him down on his way into the Capitol to testify \u2014 then they were again disappointed.\n\nMueller showed up, reluctantly, to the House side of the Capitol as exactly what he\u2019d promised to be: the living embodiment of a dry, 448-page report and nothing more. Asking Mueller to reflect on the president\u2019s state of mind was like expecting Siri to offer up her thoughts on Hegel.\n\nSo now Democrats are left with the same question that\u2019s increasingly divided the party in recent weeks \u2014 and is almost certain to spill out into the party\u2019s nomination contest, too.\n\nShould they impeach Donald Trump?\n\nLeaving political calculation aside for the moment, the answer depends, I suppose, on what you think impeachment is really for.\n\nIf you\u2019ve grown up in America and you\u2019re under, say, 30, you may not realize that impeachment wasn\u2019t always bandied about as a remedy for bad presidents. Until Richard Nixon\u2019s presidency collapsed in 1974 (he really was caught saying some pretty shocking things on tape), the idea of impeachment was mostly considered a historical oddity, like dueling with pistols, or mock turtlenecks.\n\nBut then came Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky and something called the Starr report, and like so much else in our politics, the extreme became the perfectly plausible. That\u2019s especially true now, given what we know about the ugly circumstances of Trump\u2019s election and his bullying of prosecutors and witnesses.\n\nNot since Clinton\u2019s nadir has the possibility of impeachment taken on so much weight or relevance. Not since Nixon has any president watched members of his inner circle strike deals and go to jail as prosecutors circle the White House.\n\nEver since the Mueller report was submitted to the Justice Department (and then blatantly mischaracterized by the attorney general) in April, Mueller has overtly hinted that Congress should at least take up the question of impeachment.\n\nMueller takes the position that, since a sitting president can\u2019t be indicted, it\u2019s not up to investigators to reach any conclusion about presidential crimes; the Constitution gives that power expressly to the House.\n\nAs of this week, more than 90 Democrats in Congress have said they support impeaching Trump. Jerry Nadler, the New York congressman who chairs the Judiciary Committee, pointed this week to \u201cvery substantial evidence that the president is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d which, as you probably know, happens to be the constitutional standard for removing a commander in chief.\n\nAll of which makes for a halfway compelling case, if you look at impeachment chiefly as a legal proceeding. This seems to be Mueller\u2019s point, and Nadler\u2019s too \u2014 that the purpose of impeachment is to provide a special court system for law-breaking presidents who are otherwise shielded from prosecution.\n\nBut impeachment isn\u2019t just a trial mechanism. If it were, the Framers probably wouldn\u2019t have left us with vague language about \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d which could cover anything from murder to shoplifting. They might have left the trial business to a panel of actual judges, rather than handing the whole thing over to Congress, which was bound to be saddled with political biases and arcane rivalries.\n\nNo, impeachment isn\u2019t just a legal remedy. Nor is it a way for opposition parties to negate the results of an election, no matter how clouded by allegations of wrongdoing.\n\nIt\u2019s a political tool. It\u2019s designed specifically to carry out the public will.\n\nImpeachment is there not principally to give the government a way to level charges, but to give the electorate a way to change its mind. It\u2019s there so that if a duly elected president acts in a way that thoroughly appalls the voters and squanders their confidence in the integrity of the office, we don\u2019t have to wait for the next election to send that president home.", "link": "https://news.yahoo.com/to-impeach-or-not-to-impeach-how-democrats-should-weigh-the-question-090000806.html", "published": "2019-07-25T09:00:08+00:00"}, {"title": "White House and U.S. official's wife sued over teen's death in U.K.", "text": "This article, White House and U.S. official's wife sued over teen's death in U.K., originally appeared on CBSNews.com\n\nNearly three months after 19-year-old in a head-on collision in England, lawyers for his family are suing the Trump administration, as well as Anne Sacoolas, the wife of an American official who admitted to causing the car crash.\n\nHarry's stepsister, Larna Harber, told CBS News it's a step they never wanted to take.\n\n\"In simple words: Get her back on the plane to the U.K. Donald Trump has the authorities to do that and I can't understand why they're not,\" she said. \"She's a mom of three children \u2014 what example is this setting to her three children? \u2026 It just seems wrong.

He declared a caliphate in 2014, establishing a brutal system of theocratic rule.\n\nISIS gradually lost control over its territory in recent years and as the caliphate crumbled, al-Baghdadi had largely disappeared.

Some experts argue that he held a unique position in the group\u2019s mythology that can\u2019t be easily replaced. Al-Baghdadi\u2019s death comes at a time when ISIS is splintered and has lost territory, which could hinder the group\u2019s ability to unify behind a new ideological mission.\n\nOthers argue that his death won\u2019t have a significant impact on ISIS\u2019s operations. The group has become decentralized since losing its caliphate and no longer relied on al-Baghdadi\u2019s leadership, experts say.

There are also fears that ISIS could see a resurgence, even without its leader, because of instability in the region driven by Trump\u2019s decision to pull U.S. troops from northeast Syria and political unrest in Iraq.\n\nPerspectives\n\nMajor impact\n\nHis death robs ISIS of its figurehead\n\n\u201cAl-Baghdadi was charismatic and competent, and whoever is named as his successor \u2014 like some of Baghdadi\u2019s predecessors \u2014 may prove inept, unable to lead the caliphate\u2019s remnants or inspire the new generation. And whatever the successor\u2019s abilities, if he doesn\u2019t want to share al-Baghdadi\u2019s fate, he will need to hide and avoid communicating, and, thus, will face difficulties rebuilding his organization.\u201d \u2014 Daniel Byman, Lawfare\n\nAl-Baghdadi\u2019s symbolic power may mean he\u2019s irreplaceable\n\n\u201cBaghdadi is significant because he declared himself the caliph and the head of a caliphate that was a rallying cry for tens of thousands of extremists around the world. That will be hard to replace.\u201d \u2014 Former U.S. antiterrorism envoy Brett McGurk to New Yorker\n\nHis death undermines the group\u2019s recruitment pitch\n\n\u201cHis death is another strike against ISIS\u2019s purported legitimacy, leaving it less able to claim to be any different from other violent extremist groups.\u201d \u2014 Michael Safi, the Guardian\n\nA series of major defeats may mean ISIS is too weak to recover\n\n\u201cThat the Islamic State can easily survive the loss of its top leader is not as straightforward a proposition as seems to be widely believed. Mr. al-Baghdadi\u2019s death, almost exactly seven months after the obliteration of the physical caliphate he built, comes at an exceptionally bad time. The organization is still struggling to recover from the collapse of its caliphate and the deaths of many top leaders. It is fragile, caught somewhere between being a proto-state and a full-fledged insurgency.\u201d \u2014 Hassan Hassan, New York Times\n\nLimited impact\n\nISIS is strong enough to endure al-Baghdadi\u2019s death\n\n\u201cThere was definitely a time when killing Baghdadi could\u2019ve stopped ISIS\u2019s rise. ... But I do think that the organization has moved well past Baghdadi in the same way that al-Qaeda moved past Osama bin Laden, to some extent. At this point \u2014 seven-plus years after the rise of ISIS \u2014 his death is far from a fatal strike against the organization.\u201d \u2014 Former U.S. National Counterterrorism Center director Michael Leiter to Vox\n\n\u201cYet, despite what seems like good news, there are many indicators that Trump\u2019s war on terror is short-sighted, un-strategic, and will \u2014 ultimately \u2014 increase threats from terrorism.\u201d \u2014 Peter R.

A \u201clong duration of low humidity and dry vegetation will make this a very critical event!\u201d NWS Los Angeles said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe dire weather warnings came just days after Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) declared a statewide emergency over wildfires \u2014 and amid an unprecedented wave of blackouts ordered by Pacific Gas & Electric, which has shut power to millions of customers in an effort to curb fire risk. Newsom has called the shut-offs \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s largest utility has told regulators that a jumper on one of its transmission towers broke close to where the Kincade Fire started, near Geyserville. The cause of the fire, which has been burning since Wednesday, is under investigation as 4,548 firefighters battle the blaze.\n\nMonday was a relatively quiet night on the front lines of the Kincade Fire. Cal Fire said Tuesday that the blaze barely grew overnight, though at 75,415 acres \u2014 an area more than twice the size of San Francisco \u2014 it is already California\u2019s biggest fire of the year. The fire is now 15 percent contained, and officials said they expected it to burn until at least Nov. 7.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFirefighters got a brief reprieve Monday when gusts died down, but they struggled to keep pace with the expanding blaze as winds changed direction, officials said. Even as officials lifted mandatory evacuation orders for parts of the county along the Pacific coast, they issued new evacuation warnings for a part of Lake County as the flames threatened to lurch eastward.\n\nAt least 124 structures have been destroyed in the fire, but no injuries of civilians have been reported \u2014 and there have been no deaths attributed to the blaze, which is burning in the same region where 22 people were killed in the Tubbs Fire in 2017. Officials said two firefighters had been injured, and one who was burned was in stable condition.\n\nEvacuations have largely gone smoothly as the nation\u2019s most populous state adapts to increasing wildfires that many officials link to climate change. Sonoma County Sheriff Mark Essick said Tuesday at a news conference that Northern California residents will have to be patient as they await the chance to return home.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to kind of wait and see how the winds behave, how the fire behaves, before we can talk about repopulation,\" he said.\n\nEmergency responders on the other end of the state are trying to beat back a fast-moving brush fire that has consumed about 656 acres on the western edge of Los Angeles \u2014 a slight growth since Monday \u2014 and forced the evacuation of more than 7,000 homes. Fire officials said Tuesday that the Getty Fire was 5 percent contained. At least eight homes have been destroyed in the blaze, and six others have been damaged, officials said.\n\nThe International Association of Fire Fighters has more than 4,500 firefighters battling blazes across California, spokesman Timothy Burn said Tuesday. About 419 of those firefighters live in zones that have been evacuated.\n\nAD\n\nThe Getty and Kincade fires have been sparked by hurricane-like winds that for three years have caused fiery infernos to break out across the Golden State, which is coming to accept the blazes as the new normal. The gusts are known as Diablo winds in the San Francisco Bay area and Santa Ana winds in Southern California.\n\nAD\n\nRed flag warnings are up for the San Francisco Bay area and much of north-central California. The most volatile conditions in the vicinity of the Kincade Fire are forecast to occur from Tuesday through Wednesday afternoon, when winds in higher elevations may reach 65 mph.\n\nOffshore winds are also anticipated for lower elevations, which will lead to extremely dry air that is conducive for rapidly spreading wildfires. The ongoing offshore wind event, which is powered by the difference in air pressure between the Great Basin region and coastal California, is not anticipated to bring winds as high as the event over the weekend when the blaze began.\n\nAD\n\nNorthern California faced a blast of wind Wednesday and Thursday, and again over the weekend, when it was whipped with hurricane-force gusts. The coming surge this week, on Tuesday and Wednesday, is expected to be the third windstorm in quick succession.\n\nAD\n\nThe repeated high wind events are resulting in dry vegetation that will burn easily if any new fires ignite. In fact, forecasters in San Francisco said they have never before seen three red flag warning events in a seven-day period.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in this business for 28 years; I\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d said Steve Anderson, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service\u2019s forecast office serving the San Francisco Bay area.\n\nAD\n\nResidents of Southern California, particularly from Los Angeles and Ventura counties south to San Diego, are gearing up for what could be a record-setting Santa Ana wind event beginning around midnight Tuesday night and continuing through Thursday. A red flag warning has been hoisted for the metro L.A. area, where winds could gust as high as 80 mph in higher elevations and canyons and reach 70 mph in valley locations.\n\nAD\n\nIn an ominous sign, the National Weather Service said early Tuesday that the upcoming event promises to be a \u201chigh end dangerous event.\u201d One indicator of this is that the air pressure gradient, which controls how strong the winds will be, is forecast to be at record-high levels for late October and early November. In general, the greater the pressure gradient, the stronger the winds, since air flows from high to low pressure.\n\nGiven that there have been many Santa Ana wind events during this period, a record-setting event would be particularly dangerous and could cause significant damage of in the form of downed trees and power lines and minor structural damage, according to the NWS. Any fires that occur during this period could be nearly impossible to control.\n\nKim Bellware, Kayla Epstein, Derek Hawkins, Hannah Knowles and Jason Samenow contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/10/29/california-fires-kincade-fire-map-expands/", "published": "2019-10-29T00:00:00"}, {"title": "With a tweet and photo, Trump feeds intrigue about a classified military dog in Baghdadi raid", "text": "\u201cOur canine, as they call \u2014 I call it a dog, a beautiful dog, a talented dog \u2014 was injured and brought back,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe Pentagon kept most details about the covert canine, including its name and background, on a tight leash.

The U.S. military once recognized canines for such exceptional service but suspended the practice amid complaints that it diminished the service of humans, according to an Army history of military dogs.

Only 6 percent of respondents supported the pro-Beijing camp.\n\nWong is not a central figure in the current unrest, which is largely leaderless. But he remains the most internationally recognized of the city\u2019s democracy activists, having shot to fame as a leader of the 2014 Umbrella Movement calling for universal suffrage. He was jailed three times for his role in the protests and was most recently released in June, before being arrested again in August.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nChina has characterized Wong as a separatist, and President Xi Jinping has said any effort to challenge Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong is a red line for the ruling Communist Party.\n\nAgnes Chow, another democracy activist and a member of Wong\u2019s party, was disqualified from running in elections in 2018. A Hong Kong court overturned the ban in September, ruling that there was a breach of procedural fairness.\n\n\u201cAll this clearly contravenes the international standards of free and fair elections,\u201d said Chan, the university professor. \u201cThe integrity of the entire electoral system is therefore undermined by such illiberal practices by the government.\u201d\n\nWhile barring Wong from next month\u2019s contest, authorities permitted other pro-democracy figures to run, including some with more-radical views and others who have been disqualified from previous elections.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStill, Wong\u2019s exclusion marks a snub for one of the Hong Kong\u2019s best-known faces of protest.

Labour, the largest opposition party, has resisted the election push, and its lawmakers mostly abstained in the vote.\n\nAD\n\nSpeaking immediately afterward, the prime minister said, \u201cWe will not allow this paralysis to continue.\u201d\n\nHe then confirmed that he will try to get a Dec. 12 election by introducing a new, one-line bill requiring only a simple majority.\n\nTwo anti-Brexit opposition parties \u2014 the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party \u2014 have suggested they would back something close to that proposal, although they may object to the precise date.\n\nIn remarks that resembled a campaign speech, Johnson blamed Parliament, including rebel lawmakers from his Conservative Party, for blocking Brexit \u2014 again.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey made it inevitable that the people of this country would be retained in the E.U., against their will, for at least another three months, at a cost of another billion pounds a month,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nHe charged, \u201cThey just want to delay Brexit and cancel Brexit.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn responded that Johnson was flailing about and failing to keep his word.\n\n\u201cThis is a prime minister who cannot be trusted,\u201d Corbyn said. \u201cEvery promise this prime minister makes, he abandons.\u201d\n\nCorbyn criticized Johnson for spending 100 million pounds ($129 million) of public money on an advertising campaign urging Britons to \u201cGet Ready for Brexit\u201d on Oct. 31.\n\nAD\n\nThe opposition leader also noted that Britain hasn\u2019t had a general election in dark and dreary December since 1923.\n\nHe argued that the proposed timing by the Tories would have the effect of suppressing votes \u2014 discouraging participation by students who have left school for the holidays and elderly folk who might be less willing to vote on a day when the sun sets so early, at 3:50 p.m.\n\nLabour\u2019s continued reticence to back elections, analysts say, is related to uncertainty about how the party would fare. Some within the upper ranks of the party want to go for it, believing that Corbyn is a proven campaigner. Others fear that the party\u2019s messy position on Brexit may not go down well on the doorsteps.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRecent polling puts Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party 10 points ahead of Labour.\n\nHowever, as Theresa May, Johnson\u2019s predecessor, knows only too well, polls can shift dramatically over the course of a campaign. In the last general election, in 2017, May went in expecting to get a clear majority and mandate, but ended up losing her parliamentary majority instead.\n\nDuring Johnson\u2019s tenure, as long as the thrust of the opposition effort was to block a chaotic no-deal exit, Labour was able to hold together smaller opposition parties, as well as some members of Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party, to frustrate the prime minister\u2019s plans. But now that the threat of a no-deal Brexit has receded, the members of that alliance have diverged in their priorities.\n\nAD\n\nIn a series of tweets, Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland and leader of the Scottish National Party, explained why she was supporting an early general election.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFor all his bluster, Johnson would much prefer to fight an election with Brexit already \u2018delivered,\u2019 \u201d Sturgeon wrote. \u201cAn election now would instead force him to explain his failure to keep his 31 October \u2018do or die\u2019 promise and also defend his bad deal.\u201d\n\nThe offer from Brussels to postpone Brexit another three months beyond the Oct. 31 deadline came in response to a formal request from Johnson, who was forced by his own lawmakers to ask for more time.\n\nJohnson successfully negotiated a divorce deal with E.U. leaders, and the House of Commons approved it in principle, but British lawmakers rejected Johnson\u2019s fast-tracked timetable, saying they want more time to scrutinize and debate it.\n\nAD\n\nJohnson wrote back to the E.U. leadership on Monday: \u201cI very much hope we can put this difficult period behind us.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAccording to the terms agreed to by the 27 remaining E.U. countries, Britain could still leave before the end of January if Parliament ratifies the separation deal ahead of time. In Europe\u2019s jargon-loving precincts, that means Britain got a \u201cflextension.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe EU27 has agreed that it will accept the UK\u2019s request for a #Brexit flextension until 31 January 2020,\u201d European Council President Donald Tusk said Monday on Twitter. Ambassadors agreed to the deal without calling in national leaders for an in-person meeting, a sign that the decision was not especially controversial.\n\nAD\n\nEuropean leaders are tired of debating Brexit \u2014 especially at a moment when many European economies are flagging, extreme parties are still nipping at their heels and many citizens just want to move on. But leaders also fear the economic instability that would result from kicking Britain out before there\u2019s an approved deal to manage the withdrawal.\n\nAD\n\nMonday\u2019s delay was granted on the condition that British representatives in the E.U. agree not to obstruct the body\u2019s decision-making while they linger inside the club, as Johnson has at times threatened to do.\n\nThe E.U. leaders also want Johnson to name a European commissioner, a kind of senior E.U. bureaucrat, because each member country is required to do so under E.U. treaties.\n\nAD\n\nNaming someone would be another politically symbolic defeat for Johnson. Not naming a commissioner would violate the E.U. treaties, potentially opening the bloc\u2019s decisions to legal challenges and upsetting the Europeans.", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/eu-pushes-brexit-until-end-of-january-british-prime-minister-johnsons-request/2019/10/28/c53839cc-f967-11e9-9534-e0dbcc9f5683_story.html", "published": "2019-10-28T00:00:00"}]}}}
